      <h1>Alternative Means of Transportation in NYC from 1:00-5:00 a.m. During Subway Shutdown</h1>

      <div>

        <p class="paragraph center"> For the first time in the history of New York City, everyday from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., the subway system shuts down for cleaning and disinfection. This new mandate began on May 6th, after the Coronavirus pandemic
          killed
          over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/official-toll-new-york-city-coronavirus-dead-may-be-missing-n1205496">20,000 New Yorkers</a>.
          The attempt to disinfect the subway system is important for ensuring the health and safety of MTA passengers, but that does not change the fact that an estimated <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/nyregion/new-yorkers-working-overnight-shifts.html"> 108,000 New Yorkers</a>
          need to get to work during the hours of the subway shutdown, and
          about <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2020/5/5/21246343/nyc-subway-overnight-shutdown-coronavirus"> 11,000 of those New Yorkers</a> rely on the subway system during those hours.

        Listed below are alternative options for transportation in NYC available to New Yorkers that need to get to work from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.. Next to the graphic of each
        transit option is how affordable each option is, and what the benefits of choosing each of these options can be.

          Overnight Buses. New York City has enacted an enhanced overnight bus service from 1-5a.m. All of these buses only cost $2.75. There are also three new temporary bus routes which will operate every 20 minutes from 1-6 a.m. For more
          information on New York Cities new bus schedules, please <a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/overnight"> click here </a>. This is probably the best option for people traveling to work in the city during these overnight hours, since it
          is the most affordable and readily available. The negatives to this
          means of transportation would be potential close contact to fellow passengers, as well as unforeseen delays.

          During the pandemic, taxi drivers have struggled with low ridership. Due to people staying at home and not traveling to Manhattan, Taxi drivers are facing major difficulties staying afloat, with their ridership decreasing by nearly 90%
          according <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/05/11/coronavirus-covid-19-new-york-city-taxi-industry-taxi-and-limousine-commission-uber-lyft/"> to cbs local</a>. You can read more about Taxi driver's struggles <a
            href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nyc-taxi-pandemic-food-delivery/"> here</a>. Cabs have been a staple
          in NYC for decades, and that is due to their reliability and pricing. They are not the cheapest travel option, but they are usually readily
          available since they run 24/7. An average cab ride in NYC is about $10, before tip (usually 10-15%). <a href="https://www.introducingnewyork.com/taxis"> Here is more on their pricing</a>. Taxis are less expensive than Uber for more
          congested, quick trips around the city. There is also the
          benefit of traveling alone.

          For longer trips throughout the city, Uber can be less expensive than Taxis. Uber is also convenient because you pay through the app, which allows for a zero contact experience. Uber operates 24/7 in NYC and usually arrives within minutes
          of calling. Uber is thriving in NYC due to its reliability and affordability. There are also different options for each Uber you call which will determine the pricing of every trip. <a

          picking an Uber or Taxi when getting to work overnight.

          Citi Bikes advertises itself as a “fun and affordable way to get around.” If you have the app, you can get either a day pass or an annual membership. A day pass allows for 24 hours of access and costs $13.15. However, each ride can only be
          up to thirty minutes. After thirty minutes, it’s an additional $4.00 every 15 minutes. For more information on the day passes for citibike, <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing/day">click here</a>.
          For frequent riders, the annual pass is the most economically sound. This membership costs $175.00 a year, and allows for unlimited 45 minute rides. After the 45 minutes is up, if you are still using the bike, it’s an additional $0.15 a
          minute. For more information on annual membership fees, <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing/annual"> click here</a>.
          This plan can work great for New Yorkers who can bike to their jobs in 30-45 minutes, and have Citi Bike stands close by. However, in the colder months, this might not be the best option. Citi Bike is available 24/7 365 days a year.
